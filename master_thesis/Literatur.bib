abstract = {Rail detection, essential for railroad anomaly detection, aims to identify the railroad region in video frames. Although various studies on rail detection exist, neither an open benchmark nor a high-speed network is available in the community, making al- gorithm comparison and development difficult. Inspired by the growth of lane detection, we propose a rail database and a row- based rail detection method. In detail, we make several contribu- tions: (i) We present a real-world railway dataset, Rail-DB, with 7432 pairs of images and annotations. The images are collected from different situations in lighting, road structures, and views. The rails are labeled with polylines, and the images are catego- rized into nine scenes. The Rail-DB is expected to facilitate the improvement of rail detection algorithms. (ii) We present an ef- ficient row-based rail detection method, Rail-Net, containing a lightweight convolutional backbone and an anchor classifier. Specif- ically, we formulate the process of rail detection as a row-based selecting problem. This strategy reduces the computational cost compared to alternative segmentation methods. (iii) We evaluate the Rail-Net on Rail-DB with extensive experiments, including cross-scene settings and network backbones ranging from ResNet to Vision Transformers. Our method achieves promising perfor- mance in terms of both speed and accuracy. Notably, a lightweight version could achieve 92.77\% accuracy and 312 frames per second. The Rail-Net outperforms the traditional method by 50.65\% and the segmentation one by 5.86\%. The database and code are available at: https://github.com/Sampson-Lee/Rail-Detection.},

The central insight is the YOLO algorithm improvement is still ongoing.This article briefly describes the development process of the YOLO algorithm, summarizes the methods of target recognition and feature selection, and provides literature support for the targeted picture news and feature extraction in the financial and other fields. Besides, this paper contributes a lot to YOLO and other object detection literature.}

abstract = {In digital image processing, thresholding is a well-known technique for image segmentation. Because of its wide applicability to other areas of the digital image processing, quite a number of thresholding methods have been proposed over the years. In this paper, we present a survey of thresholding techniques and update the earlier survey work by Weszka (Comput. Vision Graphics & Image Process 7, 1978, 259–265) and Fu and Mu (Pattern Recognit. 13, 1981, 3–16). We attempt to evaluate the performance of some automatic global thresholding methods using the criterion functions such as uniformity and shape measures. The evaluation is based on some real world images.}

abstract = {A theoretical study was undertaken to determine if infrared thermography is an appropriate method to identify the condition of railway track ballast. Within this study the optimal conditions for an infrared survey were established. A laboratory experiment was undertaken to identify clean and spent ballast using an infrared camera. By cooling the ballast and watching it heat up to room temperature over time a difference in the rate of heat transfer between the two types of ballast was observed. A field trial of the infrared camera was undertaken over an operational track as part of the work within a normal track maintenance possession. The field trial identified an area of dirty ballast within a section of clean ballast and the findings were also confirmed by using ground penetrating radar and a trial pit. The laboratory and fieldwork are described in detail and sample infrared images as well as visual images of the same area are given — along with calculated values for the emissivity. The findings proved that it is possible to calibrate an infrared camera so that it can determine the condition of the ballast. Also from the success of the field trial it was shown that infrared thermography is a suitable method of identifying the condition of ballast on an operational track}
