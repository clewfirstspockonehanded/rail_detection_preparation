abstract = {Rail detection, essential for railroad anomaly detection, aims to identify the railroad region in video frames. Although various studies on rail detection exist, neither an open benchmark nor a high-speed network is available in the community, making al- gorithm comparison and development difficult. Inspired by the growth of lane detection, we propose a rail database and a row- based rail detection method. In detail, we make several contribu- tions: (i) We present a real-world railway dataset, Rail-DB, with 7432 pairs of images and annotations. The images are collected from different situations in lighting, road structures, and views. The rails are labeled with polylines, and the images are catego- rized into nine scenes. The Rail-DB is expected to facilitate the improvement of rail detection algorithms. (ii) We present an ef- ficient row-based rail detection method, Rail-Net, containing a lightweight convolutional backbone and an anchor classifier. Specif- ically, we formulate the process of rail detection as a row-based selecting problem. This strategy reduces the computational cost compared to alternative segmentation methods. (iii) We evaluate the Rail-Net on Rail-DB with extensive experiments, including cross-scene settings and network backbones ranging from ResNet to Vision Transformers. Our method achieves promising perfor- mance in terms of both speed and accuracy. Notably, a lightweight version could achieve 92.77\% accuracy and 312 frames per second. The Rail-Net outperforms the traditional method by 50.65\% and the segmentation one by 5.86\%. The database and code are available at: https://github.com/Sampson-Lee/Rail-Detection.},

It also covers contemporary lightweight classification models used on edge devices. Lastly, we compare the performances of these architectures on multiple metrics.}

Because of its wide applicability to other areas of the digital image processing, quite a number of thresholding methods have been proposed over the years. In this paper, we present a survey of thresholding techniques and update the earlier survey work by Weszka (Comput. Vision Graphics & Image Process 7, 1978, 259–265) and Fu and Mu (Pattern Recognit. 13, 1981, 3–16). We attempt to evaluate the performance of some automatic global thresholding methods using the criterion functions such as uniformity and shape measures. The evaluation is based on some real world images.}
